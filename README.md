This is a Flutter app to help swim coaches time multiple swimmers at once. 

It was insipred by my best friend, who is a summer league swim coach, expressing his frustration with timing using paper pencil and a stop watch.
Paper gets wet, and transfering the stop watchtime to the paper means only one swimmer can be timed at a time.

Based on a figma design:

Note:
The figma may be out of date with the live app
